How to edit the last commit message in git?

>To edit the last commit message in Git, follow these steps:

>Open a terminal or command prompt.

>Navigate to the repository where you want to edit the commit message.

>Enter the following command:
git commit --amend

>This will open a text editor displaying the commit message. Modify the message as needed.

>Save and close the text editor.

>If you have already pushed the commit to a remote repository, you may need to force-push the changes:
git push --force

That's it! You have successfully edited the last commit message. Keep in mind that amending a commit rewrites its history, so only do this for commits that haven't been pushed or shared with others.
