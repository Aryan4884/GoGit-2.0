What is SSH here is the answer--
SSH or Secure Shell is a network communication protocol helps me to connect to your computer (eg http or hypertext transfer protocol, which is the protocol used to transfer hypertext such as web pages) and share data.

advantage--

The main advantage of SSH is the use of encryption to ensure the secure transfer of information between me(client) and the server(your computer). SSH allows me to execute shell commands on a remote computer in the same way as you and me were sitting in front of the physical computer.
