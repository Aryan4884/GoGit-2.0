Problem facing: While mkdir we are creating a new folder but when we try to git add . it then there is a message appears which says that working tree is clean that means that no changes were detected when you create a directory.
Reason: it is a empty folder and some file has to be added in it . We cannot commit empty directories, containing no files, to a Git repository. Thats why it is said if we want to commit empty directory just include .gitkeep file in it.
