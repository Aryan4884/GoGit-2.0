Hi, i am Kushagra, sophomore at IITH, and i like to learn new things

**Ques** - What do you really understand from SSH keys in VCS? What are the advantages of using it?

**Ans** :
- So SSH (Secure Shell) key helps us in not requiring us to validate our email/username/password again and again when we try to contribute on github by pushing, etc..
- Also its tough for someone to crack SSH keys as they are encoded using RSA encryption, and one needs both public and private keys to gain access. Public key is uploaded on github, while private key is stored in our desktops and is then we can securely connect to github, they can verify our connection and hence we dont need to repeatedly give username, password and we can work non-abruptly
